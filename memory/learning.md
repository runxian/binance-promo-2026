# Learning: Twitter & Website Promotion

## Twitter (X) Promotion Strategy (2026 Edition)
1. **Vertical Content:** Focus on a specific niche to attract a targeted audience.
2. **Threads:** Use long-form threads to provide value; they get 3x more engagement and signal expertise to the algorithm.
3. **Video Content:** Prioritize video; video posts receive 5x higher engagement rates than text-only.
4. **X Premium (Verification):** Highly recommended for reach. Verified accounts need 10x less engagement for the same reach as unverified ones.
5. **Consistency & Frequency:** Post 3-5 quality posts daily, spaced 2-3 hours apart.
6. **Smart Scheduling:**
   - Weekdays: 9-11 AM, 7-9 PM EST.
   - Weekends: 9-11 AM EST.
7. **Compliance (Safety):**
   - **Allowed:** Scheduling, bulk upload, AI generation (with human review).
   - **Prohibited:** Auto-replies to keywords, mass automated follows/unfollows, duplicate content across accounts.
